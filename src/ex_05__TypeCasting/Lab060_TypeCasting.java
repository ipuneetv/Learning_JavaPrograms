ðŸ§  Step-by-step Explanation
ðŸ“Œ Step 1: Data Types and Sizes

| Data Type | Size    | Range                                                   |
| --------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `long`    | 8 bytes | -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 |
| `short`   | 2 bytes | -32,768 to 32,767                                       |

* `9876543210` is too large for a `short`, so casting will **overflow** the data.

ðŸ“Œ Step 2: Casting from `long` to `short`

When you do:
java
short s = (short) phone_no;

Java **takes only the last 2 bytes (16 bits)** of the `long` value â€” this is called **truncation** or **data overflow**.

ðŸ”¢ Step 3: Understand Binary Truncation

Letâ€™s break down `9876543210L` in binary:

* Binary (64-bit) of `9876543210` = `00000000 00000000 00000010 01010101 11101100 11011001 10100010 10101010`

Now Java will **keep only the last 2 bytes** (16 bits):

```
10100010 10101010
```

This binary is:

```
1010001010101010 â†’ in hexadecimal: 0x16EA
```

But this is a **signed short** â€” so Java interprets it as a **signed 16-bit integer**:

* Decimal of `0x16EA` = `5866`

So, that's what gets printed.

âœ… Final Output:
```java
System.out.println(s); // Output: 5866
```
ðŸ§  Key Learning:
When you **cast a large number to a smaller type**, Java keeps only the **last few bytes**, and the rest is discarded. The remaining bits are interpreted as a new number (can be negative or positive depending on the sign bit).
